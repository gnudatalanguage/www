## packages:

As long as a 1.0.2 version is not delivered, please consider that most packages
don't really reflect the current status of the code. It would be better to use the weekly unstable releases !

- Fedora: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gdl **actively maintained.**
- Mageia: https://madb.mageia.org/package/show/application/0/arch/x86_64/name/gnudl **1.0.0**
- Debian: 
  - https://packages.debian.org/stable/gnudatalanguage 0.9.9-13 (too OLD)
  - https://packages.debian.org/unstable/gnudatalanguage **1.0.1-4**
  - https://packages.debian.org/python3-gdl **1.0.1-4** in 'unstable'
- Ubuntu:
  - http://packages.ubuntu.com/gnudatalanguage 1.0.3 in kinetic
  - https://packages.ubuntu.com/python3-gdl 1.0.3 in kinetic
- Gentoo:
  - https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-lang/gdl 1.0.0 (too old)
- Arch:
  - https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnudatalanguage/ **1.0.1**
- OpenSUSE:
  - https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=science&package=gdl-language

At the moment, you can
-  download the unstable weekly build binaries from https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/releases/tag/weekly-release, also see [#957](https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/pull/957)

## Compilation:
*or* you can compile the code.

Two mains paths : 

### script:
`Way 1` using the script `scripts/build_gdl.sh` (assuming you can be _sudo_)

 -  Assuming you already have a [c++ compiler](https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/wiki/C----Compilers) , Cmake (version > 3.2), curl or wget, git
 -  Download the gdl code, and run gdl/scripts/build_gdl.sh several times:
 - `build_gdl.sh prep` will install the required libraries. (If you are not _sudoer_ you will get a list of libs. your admin. will installed for you.)
 - `build_gdl.sh configure` will run Cmake to prepare the Make file
 - `build_gdl.sh build` will build gdl in `build`.
 - `build_gdl.sh install`. This is the simplest way to be sure the paths and the links to the libs are OK.

A summary for Ubuntu/Debian (for RH/Fedora, just change apt-get by rpm ...): 
```
apt-get install git
apt-get install curl   // December 2021 because of Qhull ...
apt-get install cmake
apt-get install g++
mkdir GDL
cd GDL
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl
cd gdl
./scripts/build_gdl.sh prep   <<-- need to be sudo to add set of official packages
./scripts/build_gdl.sh configure
./scripts/build_gdl.sh build
(./scripts/build_gdl.sh check)
./scripts/build_gdl.sh install  
```

then you should be able to start GDL by : `./install/bin/gdl`

This efficient and simple way was successfully tested on : Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS (may have a glitch due to Magicks libs), 20.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS; Debian 9, 10, Sid; Fedora 28

### cmake:

*or, traditional way*,`Way 2` using CMake :

- GDL is written in such a way you can compile it fully in user space, without being _root_, as long as all the mandatory packages (-dev/-devel) are around. If some packages are missing or outdated (e.g. Eigen3), yes, you can use a version in your user space, giving the path as a parameter to CMake (e.g. -DEIGEN3DIR=/path/to/local/Eigen3) 

- GDL can be compiled with : GCC (GNU C Compiler), Clang (LLVM), icc (Intel C compiler)

- GDL now requests CMake 3+. On some old systems (Debian 9, U 14.04) you have access to CMake 3+ with package cmake3 or equivalent module (on HPC with module) 


- You will need the wxWidgets library and the plplot drivers for wxWidgets. Sometimes the plplot drivers are not in the plplot package but in a different one, say, `plplot-driver-wxwidgets` . This is distribution-dependent, search the web.

- `plplot` **NEEDS to be compiled with option `-DENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=ON`** since GDL uses his own (patched) plplot drivers, they come with the GDL code. Hence the need for a plplot library compiled in such a way as to permit loadable drivers. Normally plplot is distributed this way under linux.

- When compiling the first time, you may be blocked because one package is missing. After installing it, it is **mandatory** to clean the cache before running again cmake (`rm -f CMakeCache.txt`)

- Compilation. Once all the packages are around, it is quite fast on multi-cores :)

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl
cd gdl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j N  (N depending the number of cores you have)
make test
```
(on my old laptop with N=4, less than 5 minutes)
